# ModI18n
 A mod for mod localization. It fatches translation files at runtime to ensure you have the latest translation available.

This repository is for the mod itself. To contribute translations, please go to [ONIi18n](https://github.com/ONI-Wiki-zh/ONIi18n).

*Read this in other languages: [简体中文](README.zh-hans.md)*

# Useage
1. For best result, it is suggested to reorder your mod list so that this mod is at the end.
2. You can change your prefered language in the mod options ingame. If you change it, please restart the game to load new translations.

# Build
Please read [Cairath's ONI Modding guide](https://github.com/Cairath/Oxygen-Not-Included-Modding/wiki) for mod develop knowledge.
